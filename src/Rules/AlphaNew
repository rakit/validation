/*
Rule to accept alphabet or  numeric or both with or without  (, . / - ' ') 

This is a new file in Rules/AlphaNew which accepts alphabets, numerics or both with or without some special characters used in the resident address like a comma, dot, space hyphen and slash (, . ' ' - /).

I was having trouble to accept home addess through the form, so I created it.

Do check it out.
